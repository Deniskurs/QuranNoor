Qur'an Noor is a serene, ad-free Islamic companion designed for your daily spiritual practice. Every feature has been thoughtfully crafted to help you stay connected to your faith -- no distractions, no clutter, just a clean and beautiful space for worship.

COMPLETE QURAN READER

Read the entire Quran with authentic Uthmanic script, beautifully rendered for comfortable reading. Switch between multiple English translations including Sahih International and Pickthall. Navigate all 114 surahs with verse-by-verse precision.

Listen to renowned reciters including Abdul Basit, Mishary Rashid, and Saad Al Ghamdi with full background playback and lock screen controls. Bookmark your favorite verses. Track your reading progress with daily streaks that keep you motivated.

Search intelligently across surahs, verses, and translations to find exactly what you need. Customize your experience with adjustable font sizes and four distinct reading themes -- Light, Dark, Night, and Sepia -- each tuned for extended comfort.

ACCURATE PRAYER TIMES

Never miss a prayer. Qur'an Noor calculates precise prayer times for your exact location using trusted astronomical methods. Choose from multiple calculation standards including ISNA, Muslim World League, Umm al-Qura, and Egyptian General Authority.

A real-time countdown keeps you aware of the next prayer. Track your daily prayers with simple swipe gestures. Set customizable notifications with gentle reminders before each prayer. Choose from authentic Adhan recordings from Makkah, Madinah, and renowned Muezzins.

The Qadha counter helps you keep track of missed prayers so you can make them up with intention and consistency.

QIBLA COMPASS

Find the direction of the Kaaba from anywhere in the world. The compass updates in real time with smooth animations, showing you the precise bearing and your distance to Makkah. Works offline once your location has been determined. Guided calibration ensures accuracy.

ISLAMIC CALENDAR

Stay connected to the rhythm of the Islamic year with Hijri dates displayed alongside the Gregorian calendar. Important occasions like Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, and the Day of Arafah are highlighted so you never miss a sacred date.

During Ramadan, access dedicated features including Suhoor and Iftar times, a fasting tracker, and a countdown for the blessed last ten nights.

DUAS AND DHIKR

Access a comprehensive collection of authentic supplications from the Fortress of the Muslim (Hisn al-Muslim). Morning and evening adhkar are organized for easy daily use. Explore the 99 Names of Allah with their meanings.

The digital Tasbih counter provides haptic feedback on each count with customizable presets and targets. Track your dhikr sessions and build a consistent practice of remembrance.

DESIGNED WITH CARE

Qur'an Noor draws its visual identity from the emerald domes of Madinah, the golden calligraphy of the Quran, and the deep midnight sky. Four reading themes adapt to your preference and environment. Full Dynamic Type support ensures readability at every text size. VoiceOver accessibility is built in throughout.

YOUR PRIVACY IS SACRED

No ads. No analytics. No tracking. No third-party SDKs collecting your data. No account required. Your location is used solely to calculate prayer times and Qibla direction -- it is never stored on any server or shared with anyone. Everything stays on your device. Your spiritual practice is yours alone.

Download Qur'an Noor and bring light to your daily worship.

Keyword strategy notes:
- "quran" without apostrophe captures more searches than "qur'an"
- "prayer times" is a high-volume search term
- "salah" and "fajr" capture users searching in transliterated Arabic
- "ramadan" captures massive seasonal traffic
- Avoid wasting characters on "app" or "free" (Apple indexes those automatically)
- The app name and subtitle are also indexed, so words already there need not be repeated in keywords unless they form valuable compound phrases

## 8. Review Notes for Apple

```
Thank you for reviewing Qur'an Noor. Here is a summary to help with the review process.

WHAT THE APP DOES
Qur'an Noor is an Islamic companion app that provides Muslims with tools for daily worship: reading the Quran, calculating prayer times, finding the Qibla direction, accessing supplications (duas), and tracking spiritual habits. All content is religious/educational in nature and sourced from authentic Islamic texts.

LOCATION PERMISSION (When In Use)
The app requests location access for two specific purposes:
1. Calculating accurate prayer times based on the user's geographic coordinates using astronomical formulas (the Adhan library computes solar position locally on-device).
2. Determining the Qibla direction (bearing toward Makkah, Saudi Arabia) for the compass feature.
Location data is processed entirely on-device. It is never transmitted to any server, stored externally, or shared with third parties.

NOTIFICATION PERMISSION
The app requests notification permission to deliver prayer time reminders. Users can enable or disable notifications for each of the five daily prayers individually. Notifications are scheduled locally using UNUserNotificationCenter and do not use any remote push notification service.

BACKGROUND AUDIO
The app uses the audio background mode to allow Quran recitation playback to continue when the user locks their screen or switches to another app. This is standard media playback behavior, similar to a podcast or music app. Lock screen controls are provided via MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.

RELIGIOUS CONTENT
All content in the app is mainstream Sunni Islamic material:
- The Quran text in Arabic with English translations (Sahih International, Pickthall)
- Supplications (duas) from "Fortress of the Muslim" (Hisn al-Muslim), a widely published and recognized collection
- The 99 Names of Allah, a standard element of Islamic devotion
- Prayer time calculations based on internationally recognized astronomical methods

There is no user-generated content, no social features, and no in-app purchases.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS
No login or account is required. On first launch, grant location permission to see prayer times and the Qibla compass. All features are immediately accessible from the tab bar at the bottom of the screen.

## 9. App Store Category Recommendations

| Field | Selection |
|-------|-----------|
| Primary Category | Reference |
| Secondary Category | Lifestyle |

Rationale:
- "Reference" is the best fit because the app's core function is providing access to the Quran (a reference text), prayer time data, and a dua collection. Most top-ranked Islamic apps in the App Store use Reference as their primary category.
- "Lifestyle" as secondary captures the daily-practice and habit-tracking aspects (prayer tracking, Tasbih, fasting tracker).
- Avoid "Education" unless the app includes structured learning content. Avoid "Books" because the app is not a single-book reader.
