## Bismillah

Qur'an Noor was born from a simple desire — to create an Islamic app that feels as peaceful as the faith it serves. No ads. No clutter. No compromise. Just a clean, beautiful space for your daily spiritual practice.

Every pixel, every interaction, every transition has been considered with care. Because your time with the Quran, your moments of prayer, your remembrance of Allah — they deserve an experience worthy of their significance.

## Design Philosophy

<br>

> *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."*

Qur'an Noor embraces a design language inspired by tranquility. The color palette draws from the emerald domes of Madinah, the golden calligraphy of the Quran, and the deep midnight sky under which the first revelations were received.

<br>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Emerald** `#0D7377` | The primary accent — evoking the sacred |
| **Gold** `#C7A566` | Warmth and reverence in every highlight |
| **Midnight** `#1A2332` | Depth and focus for dark themes |
| **Cream** `#F8F4EA` | Soft, paper-like warmth for light reading |

<br>

Four reading themes — **Light**, **Dark**, **Night**, and **Sepia** — each carefully tuned for extended reading comfort. Dynamic Type support ensures the app adapts to every reader.

<br>

## Architecture

Built entirely in **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, Qur'an Noor follows a clean **MVVM** architecture with modern iOS patterns:

```
MVVM + @Observable + SwiftData + Combine
```

- **SwiftData** for persistent storage with versioned schema migrations
- **@Observable** macro for reactive, performant state management
- **Async/Await** and structured concurrency throughout
- **Centralized audio session management** for seamless playback
- **Offline-first** design — core features work without internet

<br>

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | iOS 26+ |
| **Xcode** | 26.0+ |
| **Swift** | 6.0+ |
| **Device** | iPhone |

<br>

No external package managers needed beyond Swift Package Manager. Dependencies resolve automatically on first build.

<br>

## Privacy

Qur'an Noor respects your privacy completely:

- **Location** is used *only* to calculate prayer times and Qibla direction — never tracked, never shared
- **No analytics**, no tracking, no third-party SDKs collecting your data
- **No accounts required** — everything stays on your device
- **No ads**, ever

Your spiritual practice is yours alone.
